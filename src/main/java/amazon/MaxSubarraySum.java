 * In computer science, the maximum subarray problem is the task of finding the contiguous subarray
 * within a one-dimensional array of numbers (containing at least one positive number) which has the largest sum.
 * For example, for the sequence of values −2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4;
 * the contiguous subarray with the largest sum is 4, −1, 2, 1, with sum 6.
